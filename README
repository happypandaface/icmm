ADDING IMAGE:
make sure the c source file doesn't have gluints and stuff
after exporting to c source, (or hex'ing a RAW file (UNTESTED)
change the start of c source file so it looks like one of the
ones, just include c_image.h and change the struct to a cImage
and give it a name then mod c_image.h to include the name you
gave it, now mod textures.h to have a gluint for the new image
also make a new enum for it. then mod loadTexture in 
textures.c and use the new enum to load the texture.

TODO:
I'm writing this because I'm about to work on another project
but I really like this project and I want to come back to it.
I've got a notebook full of stuff planned, but I'll just 
put the next step here, items.
The idea is that you use "q" and "e" to cycle through your items
there's already an item class, which hand inherits from.
You use "space" "z" and "x" to use/drop/throw your items. 
Long press space uses it on your self (short uses it in front
of you), x is alternate (hand's alternate is to pick up) alternate
has long press too. then short z drops and long z throws.
So, you should start by making a ItemElement for the inventory,
all creatures should have this, it's a linear linked list of 
items.
Oh wait, what I was going to do before this is death animations
and corpses. Draw a few frames for the jelly and the gas ball
and make them create a "corpse" object on death with a single
run animation (yet to be programmed) then when you hit z with
your hand on the corpse you can pick up their items, scrolling
through with "q" and "e" until you select on with space or "z"
out of it.
